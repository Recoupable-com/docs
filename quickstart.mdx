## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```bash
https://api.recoupable.com/api
```

## API Keys

To access the Recoup API programmatically, you'll need to create an API key.

### Step 1: Access the API Keys Management Page

1. Navigate to the [Recoup API Keys Management Page](https://chat.recoupable.com/keys)
2. Sign in with your account if you haven't already

### Step 2: Create Your API Key

1. On the API Keys page, you'll see a form to create a new API key
2. Enter a descriptive name for your API key (e.g., "My Development Key", "Production API Key")
3. Click the "Create API Key" button

<Warning>
Copy and securely store your API key immediately - it will only be shown once!
</Warning>

### Step 3: Use Your API Key

Once you have your API key, include it in the `x-api-key` header for all authenticated requests:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.recoupable.com/api/fans?artist_account_id=YOUR_ARTIST_ACCOUNT_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.recoupable.com/api/fans",
    params={"artist_account_id": "YOUR_ARTIST_ACCOUNT_ID"},
    headers=headers
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://api.recoupable.com/api/fans?artist_account_id=YOUR_ARTIST_ACCOUNT_ID",
  {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    },
  }
);
```

```typescript TypeScript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://api.recoupable.com/api/fans?artist_account_id=YOUR_ARTIST_ACCOUNT_ID",
  {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    },
  }
);
```

</CodeGroup>
