## Overview

Connectors are third-party services that can be linked to accounts or entities (like artists). Once connected, the AI agent can access and interact with these services on your behalf.

### Account vs Entity Connections

- **Account connections**: Services connected to your own account (e.g., your Google Sheets)
- **Entity connections**: Services connected to an entity you manage (e.g., an artist's TikTok)

When calling this endpoint:
- **Without `entity_id`**: Returns connectors for your own account
- **With `entity_id`**: Returns connectors for that entity (requires access)
