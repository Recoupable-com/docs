## Overview

Connectors are third-party services that can be linked to accounts. Once connected, the AI agent can access and interact with these services on your behalf.

### Your Account vs Other Accounts

- **Your account**: Services connected to your own account (e.g., your Google Sheets)
- **Other accounts**: Services connected to accounts you manage (e.g., an artist's TikTok)

When calling this endpoint:
- **Without `account_id`**: Returns connectors for your own account
- **With `account_id`**: Returns connectors for that account (requires access)
