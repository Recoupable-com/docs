## Overview

Connectors are third-party services that can be linked to accounts. Once connected, the AI agent can access and interact with these services on your behalf.

When calling this endpoint:
- **Without `account_id`**: Returns connectors for your own account
- **With `account_id`**: Returns connectors for that account (requires access)

### Connector Availability

Not all connectors are available for all account types:

| Account Type | Available Connectors |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Your account | Google Sheets, Google Drive, Google Docs, TikTok |
| Artist | TikTok only |

<Info>
**Why the difference?**

This separation prevents tool collision in the AI agent. When you have an artist selected, the AI needs to know which credentials to use for each action. By keeping account tools (Google Suite) separate from artist tools (TikTok), the AI always knows whose connection to use.

See [Authorize Connector](/api-reference/connectors/authorize) for more details.
