title: 'Authorize Connector'
openapi: 'POST /api/connectors/authorize'
---

## Overview

Start the OAuth flow to connect a third-party service. This endpoint returns a URL that you should redirect to in order to complete authorization.

### Connecting for Yourself vs an Account

- **For your account**: Omit `account_id` - the connection will be stored under your account
- **For an account in your Org**: Provide `account_id` - the connection will be stored under that account
- **For an Artist, Workspace or Organization**: Provide `account_id` (e.g., artist ID) - the connection will be stored under that account

<Note>
When connecting for an artist, some connectors may have restrictions. For example, only certain connectors (like TikTok) may be available for artist accounts.
