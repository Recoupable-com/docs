title: 'Authorize Connector'
openapi: 'POST /api/connectors/authorize'

## Overview

Start the OAuth flow to connect a third-party service. This endpoint returns a URL that you should redirect to in order to complete authorization.

### Connecting for Yourself vs Another Account

- **For your account**: Omit `account_id` - the connection will be stored under your account
- **For an account in your Org**: Provide `account_id` - the connection will be stored under that account
- **For an Artist**: Provide `account_id` (artist ID) - the connection will be stored under that artist

### Why Artist Connectors Are Restricted

When connecting for an artist, only certain connectors are available (currently TikTok). This is intentional.

<Info>
**Preventing Tool Collision**

When the AI agent runs, it has access to both your account's connections (Google Sheets, Drive) and the selected artist's connections (TikTok). If artists could also connect Google Sheets, and you said "open Google Sheets", the AI wouldn't know which credentials to use - yours or the artist's.

By restricting artist connectors to artist-specific tools only, we ensure:
- **Account tools** (Google Sheets, Drive, Docs) → always use your connection
- **Artist tools** (TikTok) → always use the artist's connection

One toolkit = one owner. Zero ambiguity for the AI.

This restriction is enforced at the API level to ensure consistent behavior across all clients and prevent third-party integrations from accidentally creating ambiguous states.
