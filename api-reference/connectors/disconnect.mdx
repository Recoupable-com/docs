## Overview

Revoke an OAuth connection and remove stored credentials for a third-party service.

### Disconnecting Your Account vs Other Accounts

- **Your account's connection**: Provide only `connected_account_id`
- **Another account's connection**: Provide both `connected_account_id` and `account_id`

The `connected_account_id` is returned in the [List Connectors](/api-reference/connectors/list) response for each connected service.
