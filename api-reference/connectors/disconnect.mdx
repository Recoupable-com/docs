## Overview

Revoke an OAuth connection and remove stored credentials for a third-party service.

### Disconnecting Account vs Entity Connections

- **Your account's connection**: Provide only `connected_account_id`
- **An entity's connection**: Provide both `connected_account_id` and `entity_id`

The `connected_account_id` is returned in the [List Connectors](/api-reference/connectors/list) response for each connected service.
