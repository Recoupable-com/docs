## Overview

Revoke a **single** OAuth connection and remove its stored credentials. This only disconnects the specific service identified by `connected_account_id` — your other connections are not affected.

### Disconnecting Your Account vs Other Accounts

- **Your account's connection**: Provide only `connected_account_id`
- **An Org, Artist or Workspace connection**: Provide both `connected_account_id` and `account_id`

<Info>
**Why is `connected_account_id` required?**

An account can have multiple connected services (e.g., Google Sheets and TikTok). The `connected_account_id` is a unique identifier for each individual OAuth connection — it tells the API exactly which one to revoke. Without it, the API wouldn't know which service you want to disconnect.

You can find the `connected_account_id` for each connected service in the [List Connectors](/api-reference/connectors/list) response (`connectedAccountId` field).
