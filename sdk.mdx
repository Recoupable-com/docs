The Recoup CLI is built into the [interactive terminal](https://bash.recoupable.com) and is available to agents running inside sandboxes. It provides commands that wrap the Recoup API, so agents can perform actions like sending emails without needing direct API access.

## notifications

Send a notification email to the authenticated account's email address. The recipient is automatically resolved from your credentials — no need to specify a `to` address.

Emails are sent from `Agent by Recoup <agent@recoupable.com>`.

### Usage

```bash
notifications --subject <text> [options]
```

### Options

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--subject <text>` | Yes | Email subject line |
| `--text <body>` | No | Plain text or Markdown body (rendered as HTML) |
| `--html <body>` | No | Raw HTML body (takes precedence over `--text`) |
| `--cc <email>` | No | CC recipient (can be repeated for multiple) |
| `--room-id <id>` | No | Room ID to include a chat link in the email footer |

### Examples

**Send a simple notification:**

```bash
notifications --subject "Pulse Report" --text "Here's your weekly summary."
```

**Send with Markdown formatting:**

```bash
notifications --subject "Weekly Update" --text "# Artist Highlights\n\n- **BVB**: Release planning active\n- **sweetman.eth**: nounish EP targeting Jul 4"
```

**Send with CC recipients:**

```bash
notifications --subject "Team Update" --cc manager@example.com --cc team@example.com --text "New release scheduled."
```

**Send with a room link in the footer:**

```bash
notifications --subject "Conversation Follow-up" --text "Check the latest updates." --room-id "abc-123-def"
```

### API equivalent

The `notifications` command is a wrapper around [`POST /api/notifications`](/api-reference/notifications/create). You can also call the API directly:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.recoupable.com/api/notifications" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "subject": "Pulse Report",
    "text": "Here'\''s your weekly summary."
  }'
```
